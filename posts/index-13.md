# Retrospect on my own reviews
Do consider that a lot of this is just me writing out my thoughts and might have false information due to lack of research and just based on feeling

## It's great ~~if you ignore ...~~
While I feel that I do not have this issue in the reviews I have published, there were definitely moments when I was listening to some of those IEMs/transducers and thinking it is really good while ignoring some major flaws.  An example of this is how the olina se has quite solid soundstage but only when you focus. When doing background listening or in public, it isn't small but it doesn't have the spacious soundstage it does when you focus. Yes, I know things sound better when you focus but the change in soundstage felt very obvious compared to sound changes on other transducers. 

There are probably a few reasons for this but after doing some self reflection, I found that the main reasons are
1.  Because all the gear I have reviewed, I bought with my own money giving me some inherent bias to feeling as if I spent my money well. Do note that I haven't spent more than 100 usd on an iem. I already consider those IEMs quite expensive so do consider that I might have bias in the reviews where I buy my own stuff (especially the expensive stuff)
2. Some sort of "sheep mentality" also plays a part in tricking yourself that the flaw is not there. I try hard to stay away from this by avoiding saying anything about gear I haven't tried or clearly state that I only heard they are good and you should do your own research. I do feel like a minority doing this as I see many others talk about gear being the best (for the price point or whatever) without even trying it. Worst is when I see people saying that they don't trust their own ears being "hifi enough" and leaves it to reviewers to tell them what gear is better. 

## The magic of upgrades
My Olina SE review is probably littered with this issue quite heavily tbh. It was my first $100 IEM and I wrote my review when that was my highest end IEM. I never demoed more expensive IEMs before that meaning I did not have a point of reference for more expensive IEMs and the Olina SE was likely "the best IEM in the world" for me at that moment.

While this in of itself isn't an issue, the current me, or the future me will consider how wrong a lot of the information is in said review as I may have hyped up some aspects of the Olina SE too much and did not focus or mention some small notable details. 

## Brain burn in
Gonna try and keep this section short.  Basically I feel like "brain burn in" changes how you perceive the sound of a transducer as well as your thoughts on it quite drastically and thus I do not consider any of my demo impressions a review and take them with a grain of salt. 

To elaborate issues with demoing gear, sometimes I do not realize I might not be wearing the IEM with the perfect/good enough seal and I rarely can do any tip rolling to ensure a better fit. Other issues might be using the wrong source (for pleasing source believers, I am not one myself but you do you I guess), my mood (trust me, when you feel down, sometimes music just doesnt hit the same way), bad listening conditions (noisy environment or whatnot), and other stuff. 


## Brain freezing? Brain burn out?? unbrain burn in???
Gear I use previously kinda sets a baseline as to how I perceive the transducer I am about to use a different one (either demo or review a transducer I bought). Due to this, I kinda do not like to trust my demo impressions that much. Especially considering how I considered a lot of IEMs thin sounding due to using Rikubuds gas2 (a quite warm earbud)

## Preferences... preferences... ~~settings~~
I am definitely not a stranger to dissing other people for liking certain IEMs or gear. But I also am the type of person to hate on others who hate on IEMs that have a following. I do understand that people have their preferences and sometimes I do not like the very thing they are searching for but that doesnt mean that their opinion is invalid. It is a hard line to tread as on one hand, you are not giving your real thoughts on a certain gear being bad but on another, you are completely invalidating another person's opinion.

Eitherway, it is all just opinions at the end of the day but how do we even start to make it a more friendlier or less shit talking others? The best solution I found is just to accept these differences and just make sure that everyone understands that these are all opinions. We can all disagree but we can still be friends right?

## Conclusion
No real conclusion for this post, just wanted to rant about some issues about my own reviews/impressions and how people share their thoughts
