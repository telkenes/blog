# Reviews suck no matter how you do it
As a person who watches a lot of reviews on products I do not own and probably will never own 99.9% of them, I feel like the way reviews are presented no matter the reviewer, they all suck. I find reviews to be an important source of information when deciding to purchase a product and most of the time, I always feel as if the review is missing important aspects. 


## Objective measurements
### The Good
For starters, most products should have something objective to measure it upon. 
Some examples of this can be seen with:
- Mice: you can look at the sensor specifications and weight
- Audio: you can look at the frequency response graph
- Monitors/TVs: you can look at peak brightness 
- CPUs/GPUs: you can look at benchmark numbers
- Software: the amount of storage space, ram usage, cpu usage, etc

These examples are skewed towards my hobbies and if you think there is a product where objectivity cannot be measured then do tell me. Eitherway, the point I am trying to make with these examples is how these objective measurements should be similar if you were to buy the product (unless the company is shitty and replace components without changing the name or smthn). This means that objective measurements are a great starting point and essential to an unbias and good review. 

### The bad
The biggest issue with objective measurements is how not all measurements can be objective and subjective measurements are not standardize across reviews or even people. Looking back at the examples of objective measurements I gave, while the sensor of a mouse might be good, the build quality, the shape, or the sensor implimentation might be bad. This means that we cannot just rely on objective measurements when making a decision if a product is good or not. 


## Subjectivity
As discussed above, some part of a review for the most part will (and should) include a subjective section. The issue with this is how reviewers present their findings. For example, mice's shape can be said to be very comfy but that can only be said for them. This subjective sections sometimes are not explicitly stated in reviews and causes issues with idiots who blindly follow or people who do not have enough time to research deeper into products. For example, one might buy a mouse which is said to be comfortable for the reviewer but the buyer might feel as if the mouse is very uncomfortable as they have a different mouse grip.

### Time invested and presentation
I do not blame people who do not have the time to research deeper into a product they are buying but this comes at a cost where the reviews they read may be lacking. To elaborate further on the example above, you can make a good educated guess if a mouse is comfortable with you if the reviewer said it is comfortable if they state their palm size and grip style. The issue with this is how many normies will not know their palm size or grip style and wont even bother with learning about it. It is the opposite for nerdy people who are deeply invested into mice that will feel like a review is substantially lacking when a reviewer say that a mouse is comfy without stating their grip or palm size at the very least. 

### Repeated/Known knowledge
A lot of times, a group of products will have a common issue shared between all of them and reviewers tend to mention these hurdles in their review. The issue with this is how they elaborate why they hate said issue on the first few products which have the issue but when it becomes super common, they will just say "I have complained/talked about this too many times already." Sometimes this repeated knowledge is something which makes reviews annoying to watch/read for new comers especially if that review is the first review they watch from said reviewer.

### Tangent on "common advice"
Another issue with subjectivity is the main reason why I want to review products I have but I cannot bring myself to. 
> If you want to start being a Youtuber/Reviewer, start with reviewing the products you already own

Many people say this quote and I think it makes sense as you do not need to spend extra money when you do not have an audience. The only issue with this is how people who start reviewing with only the products they have will not know what they do not have. This is especially detrimental for reviewing budget devices as the person reviewing does not know what they are missing as they have never experience what they are missing. For starters, one might review a budget product as something that is amazing as that is all they experienced. If you were only exposed to 1 product in a category of products (such as speakers), you do not have a reference point for what is good and what is bad. It could be that the product you bought cost a lot but is complete garbage and the opposite could also be said. As such, people who are starting and doing reviews on the products they already own will likely not make a good review as they do not have an "average" benchmark as the range of their experience is only 1 product.  


## These phrases are garbage
"Its great for this price" tends to be a sign of how a reviewer who will say the comprimises that the budget product has without explaining how it actually performs compared to a flagship device. I see this especially prominent in smartphone reviews where they say that the phone isnt a flagship but doesnt explain further. I find this especially annoying as it seperates the budget category as if it is a completely different product. This leaves budget viewers to not know how much they are truly missing when purchasing a budget phone with certain corners which are cut. 


## Point systems are good but also suck
One of my favorite ways of consuming reviews is looking at different categories of which the product is rated on. This allows the viewer to see the categories which they care about and see how they are rated. The only issue with this is how the reviewer will tally up the points at the end. This is completely stupid as it does not take into account how certain categories matter less compared to others. Take for example audio equipment, IEMs/In Ear Monitors (normie definition: earphones which go into your ear), if a reviewer were to review an IEM, some categories they might come up with is: Audio, Fit, Build Quality, Additional items in box, and battery life (if wireless). If all these categories were to be scored from 0-5 and added all up, an IEM which has superb build quality and a lot of goodies in the box will score highly even with shit audio quality. This means that it is better not to tally up the points and leave them as be. 

A counter argument to this is how tallying up the points allows the product to be ranked according to its score but this makes more issues. An IEM's main goal is to produce good sound. This means that audio should give more points. But this leads into more issues as does 3 extra points in build quality compenstate the 3 lower points in audio quality? Another issue with tallying up points is how they will include aspects which is completely subjective such as the fit of the IEM into account (which you might not care as the ear's of the reviewer may be very different to yours). 

Personally, I would have a rating which summarizes the entire product according to my preferences. Then again... I complain that reviews are too subjective and the consumers are the issue. 

## Conclusion
Honestly, reviewers especially on Youtube do not cram all the important information as it is a double edge sword. For the nerds, a lot of information will feel repetitive and they will reduce the watch time of the video but on the other hand for beginners, they will learn a lot more knowledge or skip through the shitload of information as it is boring. I myself am guilty of skipping forward repetitive sections even though I appriciate them and this is where I feel like even if reviews were complete, most people will not consume them properly.
