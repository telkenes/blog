# Tripowin Olina SE Review
## Tldr
- Sound
	- Tonality is natural
	- Bass is just the right amount
	- Treble also sounds great but might be a bit piercing on some treble heavy tracks

## My buying experience
My decision to buy the tripowin olina se was mostly related to how much the value proposition the olina se provides for the price it costs. I was originally going to purchase a planar iem that costed around 100-200 USD but I was open to dd iems such as the dunu titan s, kato, and various other iems. 

You can see my compiled list of my potential next iems below:
- TinHifi T3+
- Moondrop Aria
- Dunu Titan S
- TRI x HBB Kai
- Tripowin Olina SE
- 7hz x salnotes dioko
- TinHifi P1 max
- Tangzu zetian wu
- Shuoer s12
- Moondrop KATO
- Tanchjim Hana 2021
- 7hz Timeless

Looking back at this list, I still believe that it was more likely my next iem would have been a planar but I ended up choosing the tripowin olina se just because of the value proposition it seems to provide. Of course, it really depends on what you are looking for in an iem but I was mainly looking for something that sounded natural and an upgrade to technical performance from my previous iem, the Moondrop SSP. Due to my obsession with natural sounding vocals (which the Moondrop Chu honestly lacked) and the SSP sounding so much better, the planar iems in the list seemed a bit  The Olina SE seemed to fit the bill on everything.

## First impressions
- mids are quite nice, a bit too forward for my liking but not shouty). Ss and Ts are not piercing at all on any of my songs. Timbre and tonality sounds very natural to me and vocals have body 
- Bass is tight, punchy, quite to my liking in terms of amount, no bass bleed to my ears 
- Treble sounds right, nothing wrong but nothing rlly sounds wrong. Cymbals sound great, its not sibilant 
- Fit is great for right ear but left ear fits weirdly (will try different cable cuz it seems like the connector touches my ear), it is also surprisingly light, I thought it was going to be at least the moondrop chu's weight but it felt much lighter like 50% of the chu's weight. The build was solid thou
- Seperation is great, so much better compared to the ssp. Soundstage also plays a role in this with how vocals feel center stage in my head while instruments sound further away 
- Detail retriaval is def a step up from the ssp, idk how much more details songs will have especially for my library but its just more little things that i pick up in songs. I was still kinda mind blown to how I never heard these details but it wasnt that big of a jump compared to the jump from the blon to the ssp where there were much more details that were not present in the blon.

## Sound
**Listening was done using kbear 07 eartips btw**
### Mids
One of the most important things in the midrange for me (and for most humans I guess) is vocals (mostly female vocals, you can look at my [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/telkenes) for my listening history). I felt like the Tripowin Olina SE delivered a sound signature where vocals slightly forward compared to everything else but not to the point where it is sibilant. Vocals just sounded correct, the tonality and timbre were very natural. Vocals also did not lack body with just having enough where male vocals still sounded full without it sounding muddy from bass bleed (Do note that my prefered sound signature is more warm sounds compared to neutral sounds).

Instruments also sounded correct on the olina se. The tonality and timbre sounded natural to me. Personally, I feel like my opinion on this matter should be taken with a grain of salt as I do not play any musical instruments so I do not have the best point of reference for how instruments should sound. Instruments also do not feel as forward as vocals which is a good thing as it means that vocals still take the front stage and the instruments support the vocals.

### Treble
The treble of the olina se does not sound sibilant but is not dark. It has just the right amount of energy for my library (mostly kpop). The treble extension of the olina is just ok. It definitely is not bad as it provides a very natural sound to cymbal decay and whatnot.

### Bass
Just the right amount for me, has pretty good texture and detail. May be too little bass for jpop but for kpop its more than enough.

## Technicalities
I felt like this is one area where the olina se is quite special. Considering it is a dynamic driver, it will definitely not have the best technalities at this price point considering the 7hz dioko and tinhifi p1 max exists at this price point (yesm the p1max is not 100 but it is sold at 100 on linsoul). But the seperation and resolution of the olina se is definitely great for the price. It made me surprised how I could hear vocal dubs quite clearly seperated.

Another thing I do not really listen for in iems is soundstage. Most iems I have tried just have sound in your head but some feel wider than others. The olina se has an interesting sound stage where vocals sound center while instruments sound further away. Think of it as an oval shape with 2 rings. The inner ring is where vocals are and the outer ring is where instruments sound like they are coming from. Bass as normal sounds like it originates from the back for my head.

## Other things
### Cable
Pretty good stock cable, would have liked it if they provided a mic option not for the mic but inline controls

### Eartips
Didnt really try them as I have not had good experience with stock eartips but the olina se has issues with certain eartips. Notably shorter eartips such as the raptgo eartip cause the iem to not sit further from my ear canal causing the connector to intefere with my ear and whatnot. The Kbear 07 were completely fine with the olina se in terms of comfort and sound.

## Conclusion
If I were to describe this iem in 1 word, it would be "natural". Everything just sounds correct and to my liking.

Eitherway, this is a good as fuck set, go buy it

## Thoughts on specific songs
###  Deja vu - Dreamcatcher
when the chorus hits "oh deja vu, oh dejavu, oh dejavu", the vocals of Yoohyeon/JiU feels very seperated from the instruments. While the vocals are centered and slightly intense, the instruments feel further away while also being full sounding. While on iems with worse seperation such as the chu to make it seem like all the instruments and sounds are fighting for the center stage, the olina se makes the vocals at the center stage and the instruments around them.
