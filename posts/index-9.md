# Moondrop Chu
## Tldr
- Overhyped, sounds average not great.
- Sound
	- Tonality does not sound natural
	- Bass does not hit right (covering front vent fixes it), causes electric guitars dont have proper decay
	- Treble is piercing (you might get used to it)
	- Cymbal strikes and whatnot do not have the proper decay and sounds flat
- Technicalities
	- Resolution is slightly above average
	- Soundstage is in your head (average)
- Might be worth buying the chu just to try the spring tips and get a beater iem

## My buying experience
The moondrop chu, an iem which was shilled a lot by crinacle saying the tuning was A+ so I immediately preordered it. Due to the sheer amount of hype and credibility crinacle has (in the audiophile hobby), the moondrop chu was very popular and this caused my chu batch to not ship for months due to overdemand. This allowed me to watch other people review their moondrop chu and the hype around this iem skyrocketed saying how good it sounds.

## First impressions
I was honestly hyped when I got the moondrop chu after waiting a month for it. The packaging was nicely presented, the tips felt nice, and the fit of the chu was quite good for me.

Initial impressions of the sound of the moondrop chu, I did not feel anything for it. It felt very standard but with some issues. I had a feeling that it didnt sound right and the "technicalities/resolution" of the chu was worse than the blon 03 but later I realized why I thought this (it will be discussed in the section below).

## Sound
The moondrop chu has neutral tuning with elevated upper midrange and treble making it a bit shouty and has piercing treble. I honestly do not like the way the moondrop chu sounds. 

### Midrange
Starting from the midrange, vocals feel thin and lack body. It does not matter if it is male vocals or female vocals, they both sound thin. Instruments like pianos and violins on the other hand sounded quite nice (I used running into the night by yoasobi to test this). Due to the nature of the chu's tuning having an elevated upper midrange, female vocals have a tendency to sound piercing especially on sylables that contains Fs and Ts. After using the chu for a while, it didnt bother me as much BUT some songs are still unlistenable or ruined from this upper midrange boost causing everything to sound congested and the opposite of muddy where the treble and upper midrange masks everything.

### Treble
Similarly to the upper midrange, treble also sounded piercing (I also got used to it like the upper midrange). Cymbal strikes did not have proper decay and just sounded flat. Other than that I would say it sounded ok.

### Bass
Bass is one of the weak points of the chu. The moondrop chu is definitely not a bass head set with quite little amount of bass but it is also bass which sounds awful. I found it hard to hear bass textures in songs and most of all, the decay of the bass sounded very artifical. 

#### Bass Mod
I ended up trying the mod where you cover the front vent of the chu and this improved the bass by so much. If you own the chu and want to try this mod, I would suggest listening to the intro of VIVID VICE by Who-ya Extended. The electric guitars sound so much more natural and there is actually bass rumble!!!

## Technicalities
Resolution is ok and soundstage is in your head (basically average and small)

## Other things
### Cable
The cable is garbage out of the box but seems to become better with more use? This might be batch variance but my brother also bought a moondrop chu and uses it much more than me and his cable feels so much better (flexible and doesnt bounce back) compared to mine

I am a big fan of earhooks and the lack of preformed earhooks sometimes makes the chu fall out of my ear while walking. This rarely happens but it does not feel as secure as cables with preformed earhooks.

### Eartips
The spring tips are quite great to be honest. The sticky texture they have give the iems a better grip on my ear allowing them to stay in my ear with a better seal and less likely to fall out. 

The size of the eartip on the other hand is smaller than other eartips but for my ears they are completely fine. 

My only gripe with spring tips is how the core is only hard on the bottom. This means that I can push the iem deeper than it should go and makes the iem feel uncomfortable.

## Conclusion
For the price of $20, the moondrop chu is a decent pick which honestly sounds better than a lot of mainstream options at this price point but it definitely is not an iem which I would recommend to people due the way vocals sound and how piercing it can be. I would recommend getting a used ssp or ssr which provides much better technicalities for around the same price.

On the other hand, I quite like the spring tips and it might be worth to get this iem just for the spring tips and get a beater iem. You will also get a weeb box if that matters to you
