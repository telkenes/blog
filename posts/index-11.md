# My Audio Gear Demoing Journey [0]
Do note that all these are my impressions and you may disagree with them. We all have different ears and preferences. 

# The good
## Tinhifi P1 Max
Was not expecting how good it sounds considering people like crinacle did not like this iem. Bass is solid with fast decay, mids are slightly forward which i did not expect due to the graph showing vocals being more relaxed rather than energetic. Overall a very solid set for its current asking price (around 100 on linsoul and shenzenaudio)

## Moondrop Aria Snow Edition
One of the best sub 100 iem for analytical listening. I do not like it (as a daily driver iem) as I look for sets which are more fun but bass guitars, vocals and treble performance are all very solid and analytical to the point where i just want to sit down and listen closely. Also no weird artificial airiness og aria had

## Seeaudio Yume 2
Basically a more expensive Aria SE with a bit better techs tbh

## Moondrop SSR
Sounds great for the price, sounded quite natural but also a bit boring. Might not be shouty for me due to limitations of apple dongle and android devices as the iem needs a nuclear reactor to power it fully

## Moondrop Blessing 2
Hands down one of the best tuned iems. While I really liked the tuning, midrange especially vocals had something that sounded wrong as well as the treble of the b2. I didnt really mind the bass but looking back, the bass texture isnt the best. Fit was fine but imo it is just a big iem which I don't really like. Other than that, can easily recommend this

## Moondrop Blessing 2 Dusk
Just B2 with more bass

# The mid
# ie600
Really good technicalities considering its a 1dd, vocals and treble were just fine. Bass was fighting vocals for the center stage making me not like it. Overall was not impressed with it

## Moondrop Quarks DSP
Probably on top of the mid category, for the price you are paying, this is definitely one of the best iems you can get. Tuning wise, it is very good with punchy bass (only went deep fitted) and smooth vocals. Technicalities were just fine, nothing really that spectacular. I myself do not notice the noise floor other people talk about

## Moondrop Aria
Sounded mostly fine but vocals had a bit of artificial airiness added to them making me dislike the iem. It definitely helps simulate a larger headstage thou so u might like it. Bass lacked punch and 13k definitely was hearable but not too sure how it affects longer listening sessions. For the short time i demoed it, I did not really hate it

## Moondrop Kato
I dont rlly feel anything from this iem, it just sounds boring due to how relaxed vocals sound with bass that can only be described as "a toddler trying to punch you". Technicalities are just fine, nothing really note worth in its price range especially comparing to planars and other 100 dds

## Moondrop Variations
Shouty, thin, too much bass, good technicalities 

## Shuoer s12
Weird vocal timbre, treble and vocals just sound offq

# The kms tier (some are not that bad but yes)
## Tinhifi T3+
I am greatly sorry to my past self who considered buying this iem. It sounds congested as fuck but tuning wise it is just fine. Personally I wouldnt pay more than 20 dollars for this. I dont get the hype behind it but I suppose it is one of the only decently tuned warm sets

# Final audio a4000
Artificially airy vocals, thats all I can say. 

## ie300
I just want to die listening to this iem. This iem is the embodiment of torture for audiophiles. The iem might have some good features and potentially a good driver but I wouldn't know, I can't stand listening to this amount of mud with 0 vocal clarity for more than 10 seconds

## Sony WH 1000 xm4 (headphones)
Great anc, drowned in mud, 0 clarity, low res, idk how people even like this. Mids dont even sound good
