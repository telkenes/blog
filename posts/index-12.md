# Vido - The $2 Hype Train Earbud Review
After buying some rikubuds, I kinda wanted to try the mx500 shell so I decided to buy some vidos. Considering they are $2, even if they sounded shit, I wouldnt really care as I was more interested in how comfortable the shell would feel (incase i want to buy tgx gear from jim)

All listening done with apple dongle (with android phone) in a quiet environment. 

## Blue vido (opaque)
### Vocals
Tonality is not the most natural but still very good. It is a bit rich and thick but not that detailed.

### Treble
Treble definitely doesnt have sparkle and is probably lacking for many. Cymbal hits decay a bit unnaturally having an artificially fast decay as if they are suddenly cut off. 

### Bass
Surprisingly impactful considering it is an earbud. It also has pretty ok texture and detail as well. Biggest weakest is how narrow the dynamics of the bass is.

### Technicalities
Everything feels a bit congested with everything sounding close together. The separation is just not that good on this set.

### Fit and comfort
The mx500 shell is just not that comfortable tbh. After a while it already makes my ears a bit sore.  

## Purple vido (transparent)
### Vocals
Clearer vocals compared to blue vidos

### Treble
Definitely more but still not crisp

### Bass
Has better bass dynamics allowing better replay of bass. You can hear more details compared to the blue vido. Also has more bass making the congestion a bit worst but everything else is better. A bit too much bass for my liking but it is fun. 

### Technicalities
Just slightly better than blue vido but mostly around same as blue vido 

## Conclusion 
Overall, they are both good sets with compromises but it is only $2. Tbh a must to have considering the price. 

Earbud issues are definitely real. You cannot use them outside due to noise leaks (from outside) and your music leaks out.
